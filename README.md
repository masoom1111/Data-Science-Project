# Data-Science-Project

As part of my Making Products Count (Data Science for Product Managers) course at Carnegie Mellon. A team of 3 of us, were assigned this project which aimed to answer the following description:

## Project Description

In this project you will analyze survey data around media consumption habits gathered by Deloitte in preparation for its annual Digital Democracy report.  

You will have a wide latitude in how you choose to use this data.  Potential applications include market segmentation and sizing, pricing, gathering requirements for a new product, but feel free to come up with others.  Which ever application you choose, your presentation and write-up should answer the following questions:

What problem is being solved?  
Who benefits from the problem solution?  
What does the data look like?  
How as the data prepared for modeling?  
What modeling approach did you use?  
What are the results?  
How did you evaluate the results?  
What next steps would you recommend based on your results?  

## Concepts and Libraries used
It uses Python as the programming language. The libraries used are: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.  
Follows the steps of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) -> Modelling (Supervised Machine Learning) -> Choosing the best model
